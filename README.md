This is  Team Health Heros, and we are pleased to introduce our project on Medical Prescription Handwritten Text Recognition utilizing cutting-edge technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), on Intel oneAPI server using Intel oneDAL and Intel extension for Tensorflow.üë®‚Äçüíª. 

## üìö Project Overview

The "MediScan" project aims to transform healthcare by accurately converting handwritten prescriptions into digital formats. Leveraging advanced OCR and Artificial Inteligence (AI), it enhances patient safety by reducing errors caused by manual interpretation. Developed collaboratively on GitHub, MediScan bridges traditional prescriptions with modern digital healthcare, ensuring efficient, secure, and precise medication management. 

We are confident that our project will benefit the environment and the community, and we look forward to presenting our findings and advancements in this field. 

## ‚ö° Motivation Behind our Project
The motivation behind the project stems from the critical need to address the potential risks associated with interpreting handwritten prescriptions in the healthcare domain. Handwritten prescriptions are prone to misinterpretation, leading to medication errors, adverse reactions, and compromised patient well-being. By harnessing cutting-edge optical character recognition (OCR) techniques and machine learning algorithms, this project aims to provide a reliable solution for converting handwritten prescriptions into a precise digital format. This transformation not only streamlines the prescription verification process for medical professionals but also significantly reduces the likelihood of errors that could have serious health implications. 

## ‚ö° Outcome of our Project
The core idea behind the project is to create a seamless bridge between traditional handwritten prescriptions and modern digital healthcare systems. With the increasing complexity of medical treatments and medications, the potential for errors in interpreting handwritten prescriptions becomes a significant concern. This project seeks to leverage state-of-the-art optical character recognition (OCR) technology and machine learning algorithms to accurately transcribe handwritten prescriptions into a digital, machine-readable format. By doing so, medical professionals can effortlessly access, verify, and process prescription information, minimizing the risk of medication errors, drug interactions, and dosage inaccuracies.
